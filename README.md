# ANN implementation on UCI Dataset
An Artificial Neural Network was trained on the Breast Cancer Dataset of the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Comparisions of the error were made on using different activation functions.
<br>The implementation is done from scratch and no external machine learning libraries were used. The neural network is trained using different activation functions such as 
<ul>
    <li>sigmoid <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*a04iKNbchayCAJ7-0QlesA.png">
    <li>tanh  <br><img src="https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/Screen_Shot_2020-05-27_at_4.23.22_PM_dcuMBJl.png">
    <li>ReLU <br><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/357/1*oePAhrm74RNnNEolprmTaQ.png">
</ul>
    Training and testing error sum for different activation functions is calculated and compared to get the best activation function on the given dataset.
